# Strategic Review & Enhancement Framework ([StrategicReview.md](mdc:StrategicReview.md))

## 1. Project Identity
- Clearly define the project's unique mission: sparrow-ai-tech is the developer portal for the Model Context Protocol (MCP), not just another "Sparrow" project.
- Use a tagline and mission statement that highlight MCP and its ecosystem.
- Add a "What is sparrow-ai-tech?" section to the README to clarify scope and avoid confusion with similarly named projects.
- Develop a simple, memorable visual identity (logo, motif) that reinforces the MCP connection.

## 2. Content Structure & Quality
- Organize articles into a logical learning path: Getting Started, Conceptual Guides, How-To Tutorials, API Reference.
- Apply the Four Pillars of Developer-Centric Content:
  - Clarity & Simplicity
  - Technical Accuracy
  - Scannability (headings, lists, code blocks, emphasis)
  - Path to Success (clear goals, outcomes, and next steps)
- Use the provided Content Audit Checklist before publishing any article.

## 3. Integration Best Practices
- For third-party integrations (e.g., ElevenLabs widget):
  - Never hardcode sensitive config (e.g., agent-id); use environment variables or config files.
  - Load scripts asynchronously and handle errors gracefully.
  - Ensure styling/theming is consistent with the site.
  - Document and test backend integration (e.g., webhooks to MCP servers).
  - Use the Pull Request Review Checklist for all major integrations.

## 4. Localization & Community
- Treat localization as a community-building activity, not just translation.
- Create and maintain a Czech Technical Glossary for consistent terminology.
- Use the Localization QA Checklist for all translated content.
- Translate key governance docs (CONTRIBUTING.md, PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) and foster Czech-language community channels.

## 5. Contribution & Governance
- Formalize contribution guidelines (CONTRIBUTING.md, PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- Use a public roadmap and clear issue/PR labels.
- Define community roles as the project grows (triagers, reviewers, maintainers).

This rule ensures the project is strategically positioned, content is high-quality, integrations are robust, localization is professional, and contributions are well-managed. See [StrategicReview.md](mdc:StrategicReview.md) for full details.

# Track A: Frontend & User Experience Implementation Rule

When instructed to "proceed implementing Track A":

- Only implement tasks under **Track A** in TODO.md (Frontend & User Experience).
- Work only on user-facing components, layouts, and styles using Astro and React.
- Place React components in `src/components/`, layouts in `src/layouts/`, global styles in `src/styles/`, and images in `public/assets/images/`.
- Use PascalCase for component filenames (e.g., `HeroSection.jsx`) and kebab-case for CSS classes (e.g., `.hero-section`).
- Add `data-cy` attributes to interactive elements for E2E testing.
- Do not modify backend, CI/CD, or test configuration files unless explicitly instructed.
- At synchronization points, coordinate with Track B as described in TODO.md.
- If a dependency on Track B is encountered (e.g., i18n function, API contract), pause and request handoff or clarification before proceeding.
- **Regularly commit working code to GitHub** with clear, descriptive commit messages.
- **Track progress** by checking off completed items in `TODO.md` as you finish them.
- **Add any new ideas or suggestions** to `IDEAS.md` for future consideration.
- **Mark each task in `TODO.md` with a status:** `ToDo`, `InProgress`, `Implemented`, `Tested`, `HelpNeeded`, or `Done`.
- **If you are stuck** (e.g., on tests or dependencies), set the task status to `HelpNeeded` and proceed to the next available task.

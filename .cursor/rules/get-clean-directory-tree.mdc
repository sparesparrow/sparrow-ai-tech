To obtain directory structure of the workspace without the infinite node_modules and other spam, run  `tree -I 'node_modules' -I unused -I dist -I screenshots`

To check the contents of what was produced during build, check folder `dist/`  that is intentionally ignored in the above command for output brevity.

# Writing GitHub Actions Workflows for GitHub Pages Build and Deploy

When creating or editing GitHub Actions workflows for building and deploying to GitHub Pages, follow these best practices:

- Use the official actions: `actions/checkout`, `actions/configure-pages`, `actions/upload-pages-artifact`, and `actions/deploy-pages`.
- Set the workflow to trigger on `push`, `pull_request`, and `workflow_dispatch` for flexibility.
- Always set the required permissions:
- `pages: write`
- `id-token: write`
- `contents: read` (if needed for build)
- Use a two-job pattern: one for build (producing the static site in `_site` or `dist`), and one for deploy (deploying the artifact to GitHub Pages).
- Use the `concurrency` key to avoid overlapping deployments:
```yaml
concurrency:
    group: \"pages\"
    cancel-in-progress: false
```
- For Jekyll, use `ruby/setup-ruby` to match the Ruby version used by GitHub Pages ([see versions](https://pages.github.com/versions/)).
- For static sites (e.g., React, Vue, SSGs), use the appropriate build steps (e.g., `npm ci`, `npm run build`).
- Always upload the build output as an artifact using `actions/upload-pages-artifact`.
- The deploy job should use `actions/deploy-pages` and set the environment to `github-pages`.
- Reference the actual workflow file for your project: [jekyll.yml](mdc:.github/workflows/jekyll.yml)
- For more, see the [GitHub Pages custom workflow documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/using-custom-workflows-with-github-pages)

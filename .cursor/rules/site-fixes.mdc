# Site Fixes & Best Practices ([sparrow_site_fixes.md](mdc:sparrow_site_fixes.md))

## 1. Configuration Consistency
- Choose a single stack: Jekyll (recommended for GitHub Pages) or React with Vite. Do not mix both.
- Remove unused config files for the stack you are not using (e.g., remove Jekyll files if using React, and vice versa).

## 2. Directory Structure
- Use this canonical structure:
  - `assets/images/` for all images
  - `assets/css/` for stylesheets
  - `languages/` for translation files
  - `public/` only for files that must be at the web root (e.g., favicon)

## 3. Asset & Path Management
- Reference assets using Jekyll's `relative_url` filter for portability:
  ```html
  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/screenshot-ui.png' | relative_url }}" alt="UI">
  ```
- Move favicon to the root or update references to use `{{ '/favicon.png' | relative_url }}`.

## 4. Jekyll & Build Settings
- Update `_config.yml`:
  - Set `baseurl: "/sparrow-ai-tech"`
  - Exclude only non-essential files from processing (see recommended list in the source file).
  - Do not exclude the `assets` directory.

## 5. Security & Testing
- Add a Content Security Policy meta tag to your HTML head for improved security.
- Test locally with `bundle exec jekyll serve` (Jekyll) or `npm run dev` (React).

## 6. Immediate Actions
- Create missing directories and add placeholder images to prevent 404s.
- Fix all asset references and base URLs for your chosen stack.
- Stick to one approach for maintainability.

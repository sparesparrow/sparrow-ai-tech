First, check installed model context protocol servers at `.cursor/mcp.json`.
Then, search the Web for information about the detected MCP servers, browsing repositories on github, npmjs, docker hub, glama.ai, and more publishing platforms for MCP servers.
If installed MCP server is found, learn how to configure it with environment variables and commandline arguments, or other ways for configuring the MCP server.
Then, check what MCP Tools  are provided by the MCP server and learn the tool usage schema.
Then, think how each Tool might be called/triggered by the user message in natural language, so that it matches the description and provides necessary information that the LLM  needs to provide to the tool as function arguments.
Then, write results of your research into files (each MCP server to it's own file) that, if not existing yet, has to be created in folder `.cursor/rules` under name corresponding to the MCP server name, with extension `.mdc`. 
Then, proceed with whatever the user requested, prefering to use your installed MCP tools to complete the task, if applicable.

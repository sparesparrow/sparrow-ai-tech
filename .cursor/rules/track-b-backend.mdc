# Track B: Backend, Tooling & Automation Implementation Rule

When instructed to "proceed implementing Track B":

- Only implement tasks under **Track B** in TODO.md (Backend, Tooling & Automation).
- Work only on project structure, CI/CD, testing, backend endpoints, i18n setup, and automation.
- Place serverless/API functions in `src/api/` or `src/pages/api/`, test files in `cypress/` and `src/tests/`, and translation files in `public/locales/`.
- Use PascalCase for utility and API filenames, kebab-case for test files and config files.
- Do not modify frontend UI components, layouts, or styles unless explicitly instructed.
- At synchronization points, coordinate with Track A as described in TODO.md.
- If a dependency on Track A is encountered (e.g., data-cy selectors, UI handoff), pause and request handoff or clarification before proceeding.
- **Regularly commit working code to GitHub** with clear, descriptive commit messages.
- **Track progress** by checking off completed items in `TODO.md` as you finish them.
- **Add any new ideas or suggestions** to `IDEAS.md` for future consideration.
- **Mark each task in `TODO.md` with a status:** `ToDo`, `InProgress`, `Implemented`, `Tested`, `HelpNeeded`, or `Done`.
- **If you are stuck** (e.g., on tests or dependencies), set the task status to `HelpNeeded` and proceed to the next available task.

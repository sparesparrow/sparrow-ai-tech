## Introduction

As AI systems become increasingly agentic—capable of reasoning, planning, and executing complex workflows—there remains a critical need for seamless collaboration between human users and autonomous agents. The **human-action** concept within the Model Context Protocol (MCP) ecosystem addresses this need by providing a standardized mechanism for integrating human input, oversight, and intervention into automated LLM-driven processes.

## What is human-action in MCP?

In the context of MCP, **human-action** refers to a protocol-defined tool or action type that allows an agent (such as an LLM or workflow orchestrator) to explicitly delegate a step in its workflow to a human user. This can take many forms, including:
- Requesting human approval before executing a sensitive operation.
- Asking a user to provide missing information or resolve ambiguity.
- Inviting a human to review, edit, or augment generated content.
- Pausing an automated workflow until a human completes a required task.

By formalizing these interactions, human-action enables robust "human-in-the-loop" (HITL) workflows, which are essential for safety, compliance, and high-quality outcomes in real-world AI systems.

## Architecture and Protocol Design

### 1. Tool Definition in MCP
- **Tool Schema:** In MCP, tools are defined with a schema that describes their inputs, outputs, and invocation semantics. A human-action tool is typically defined with:
  - A clear description of the required human input or decision.
  - Input fields for any context or data the agent can provide.
  - Output fields for the human's response or action taken.
- **Invocation:** When an agent reaches a step requiring human input, it issues a tool call of type human-action. The MCP client (e.g., an IDE, web app, or chat interface) then presents the request to the user in a structured, actionable format.

### 2. Workflow Integration
- **Agentic Pause/Resume:** The agent's workflow is paused until the human completes the action, at which point the agent resumes with the new information or approval.
- **Auditability:** All human actions are logged as part of the workflow trace, supporting compliance and post-hoc analysis.
- **Extensibility:** The human-action pattern can be extended to support multi-step approvals, branching logic, or escalation to different user roles.

## Use Cases and Value Propositions

### 1. AI Safety and Oversight
- **Sensitive Operations:** Require human approval for actions with significant consequences (e.g., financial transactions, code deployment, data deletion).
- **Ethical Guardrails:** Ensure that LLMs do not make decisions outside their intended scope or expertise.

### 2. Collaborative Content Generation
- **Co-Creation:** Allow humans to review, edit, or enhance AI-generated text, code, or designs before finalization.
- **Feedback Loops:** Collect user feedback to improve prompt engineering and model performance over time.

### 3. Workflow Automation with Human-in-the-Loop
- **Exception Handling:** Route ambiguous or novel cases to human experts for resolution.
- **Progressive Automation:** Start with human-heavy workflows and gradually automate steps as confidence grows.

## Example: human-action Tool in an MCP Workflow

Suppose an LLM agent is orchestrating a software deployment pipeline. At the "approve deployment" step, it issues a human-action tool call:

```json
{
  "tool": "human-action",
  "description": "Approve or reject the deployment to production.",
  "inputs": {
    "change_summary": "Upgrading backend API to v2.1.0"
  },
  "outputs": {
    "approval": "pending"
  }
}
```

The MCP client presents this to the user, who can approve or reject the deployment. The agent then continues based on the user's decision, ensuring both automation and human control.

## Strategic Value in the MCP Ecosystem

- **Standardization:** By defining human-action as a first-class tool type, MCP enables consistent, interoperable HITL workflows across clients, servers, and agents.
- **Safety and Trust:** Human-action provides a built-in mechanism for oversight, reducing the risk of runaway automation or unintended consequences.
- **Scalability:** As organizations automate more processes, human-action allows for selective intervention, balancing efficiency with control.
- **Ecosystem Integration:** Tools like mcp-prompts, mcp-router, and mcp-project-orchestrator can all leverage human-action to create rich, collaborative workflows that combine the strengths of humans and AI agents [[5](https://github.com/sparesparrow/mcp-prompts)].

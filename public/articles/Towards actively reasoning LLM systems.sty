Towards actively reasoning LLM systems

In this post, I’m sharing some thoughts on the emerging intersection of foundation models, cognitive architectures and compound systems that try to reach for more than the sum of their parts, a limited form of artificial general intelligence or as I prefer to call it, artificial human intelligence. The topic is complex, it requires a shared understanding of several concepts, that’s why I have to start with concepts and theory first. This shall bias our thoughts towards:

Iterative Updating theory of working memory by Reser (2023)

Roughly speaking, it suggests you can understand the evolution of the next focus of attention as a similarity search within associations in long term memory, roughly you can think of your working memory working as a content recommendation engine of unseen sophistication, compatible with processing along a continuum between system 1 and system 2 extremes, with system 2 emerging from system 1.

What is called thinking?

Common definitions are: thought is the product of mental activity, conscious cognitive processes that can happen independently of sensory stimulation, reasoning power, the power to imagine, the process of using your mind to consider something. Thinking is, rather broadly, the collection of all mental events and processes, including perception, memory, decision making, judgement and action. In cognitive psychology, a thought, idea, gist, as the basic unit of meaning, is often formalized as a proposition, a claim with a subject, verb, object. We can see that language and thought are associated with each other, that is to say, there are amodal representations we use to reason about the world. Reasoning in turn refers to the logical assertions humans make about the world resulting in various claims about the world. Realise that thought is NOT limited to logical operations and statements. For example, perception and imagination are thought, too, not only reasoning, but reasoning is paramount for higher cognition.

Reasoning is usually understood as making logical inferences. But there is a second interpretation: That reasoning is in itself an algebraic transformation in order to answer a question (Bottou, 2011). The main claim of this text here is that logical reasoning emerges from a convergence towards new abstractions, active reasoning that differentiates causal assertions backed by quality world knowledge.

There is a third interpretation of reasoning: Reasoning is a higher order executive function, meaning reasoning allows you to steer your thoughts. However, the relation is also inverse, propositional thought biased by your executive functions gives rise to reasoning.

Reasoning has a fourth meaning: It is an expression of human general intelligence. This is the time where we have to think about what has been suggested as the basic mechanism of cognition, the cognitive atom: Cognitive cycles. I use the well known LIDA theory as a foundation for my sketch of an LLM based cognitive architecture. In a nutshell, LIDA states that cognition is a repetitive cycle of perception, understanding and action. Yet, LIDA does not give a clear hypothesis on why your next thought arises.

For Heidegger, thinking is thanking: Thinking stems from gratitude towards the ideas your mind generates from your memories, so that by association, an adaptive, self-organising process can emerge. That which is thought provoking gives us to think: that which must be thought commends us to think it. From that point of view, you can say that your mind operates by recommending you what you might want to think about next, your focus of attention is self-organising, you have to be mindful to accept it in gratitude for what it is, regardless how much bottom up ideation or top down filtering like critical thinking is involved.

Your next thought can be understood as an attractor in the phase space of the dynamical system that gives rise to your mind: Your brain. Accordingly, in dynamical systems neuroscience (John et al, 2022), thoughts can be understood as an attractor in neural activity phase space: Cortical assemblies (also neuronal cortical columns) or micro-representations, that receive sufficient activation start to inhibit surrounding columns automatically. The source of the critical activation can be top down attention or bottom up from perception and priming. That means, activation and representation learning is self-organising, giving proper long term memories. The consequence for reasoning is, that it can operate in autopilot if it is only using information from long term memory. Active reasoning on the other hand requires the construction of new meaning, of new representations. Logical thought come in shades of gray between recall (you repeat a rote learned assertion to apply it by direct pattern matching), recognition (your priming happens to result in the right logical assertion being confabulated) or construction (executive functions are used to construct new assertions, carefully checking congruence with your world knowledge, by steering pattern matching and confabulation). You can now start to sense that the algorithmic interpretation of reasoning, the one as higher order executive function, as expression of general intelligence in logical thought all seem to share similar processes. Let’s work towards understanding how it all comes together. There are several entrances, i.e. examining the processes of working memory is the most direct path, but let’s pick intelligence as an entrance, as it is the broadest concept.
Working definitions of intelligence, general intelligence and how is thinking related to general intelligence?

Many people conflate the meaning of intelligence with the meaning of intellect, although intellect is merely a higher instantiation of intelligence. These are all just made up concepts, with made up meaning that at some point became a convention, which itself is an algorithm for converging towards better representations of reality. Instead of reinventing the wheel, let’s try to understand what might have been an attractor. Intelligence is a word of latin origin and means “to choose between different options”. This implies nothing about how or how smart the choice is made. Accordingly, intelligent agents in AI literature range from dumb reflex agents to learning or more sophisticated utility based agents. An if-else rule is an instance of intelligence, as is a decision tree classifier. Obviously, those examples have very limited intelligence with limited flexibility. Researchers from many angles, i.e. psychology, AI research or dictionary writers came up with various definitions on intelligence (i.e. see Legg & Hutter, 2007), showing it is a multifaceted concept, however, the broadest common denominator is in in “making (good) choices (efficiently)”. Wang (2019) proposed that: “Intelligence is the ability for an information processing system to adapt to its environment with insufficient knowledge and resources.” Personally, I think psychology has the natural tendency to develop an anthropocentric understanding of intelligence, where the reflective intelligence of the mind, the intellect, is taking the center stage. Intelligence does not only reside within brains, as genetic mutation and natural selection demonstrate as well as some organisms that can process information for adaptive purposes, without a brain. It becomes obvious by now that there seems to be not only different but “more” vs “less” or “higher” vs “lower” instantiations of intelligence. Think that that AI will do the same to our anthropocentric understanding of intelligence as the discoveries of Galileo did to our understanding of planet earth in the universe. We do not stand at the center, but nonetheless at a rare spot (knowing there are likely better earthes).

A general definition of general intelligence proposed in Goertzel (2021) looks like this: “general intelligences is seen as complex, self-organizing, self-constructing systems that recognize and form patterns in themselves and their environments.” It is important to note that he describes general intelligence as multiple criterion driven (i.e. maxing out joy, personal growth, choice opportunities), that promote intellectual breadth, beyond an agents direct adaptive capability to achieve goals. Finding solutions to problems and constructing representations fit for solving various problems in one's environment is a heuristic search process, a general intelligence needs to be open-minded by design. Efficient pragmatic general intelligence formalises general intelligence as (Goertzel, 2021): “The efficient pragmatic general intelligence of an agent π with resource consumption ημ,g,T , relative to the distribution ν over environments and the distribution γ over goals, is its expected performance with respect to goals drawn from γ in environments drawn from ν, over the time-scales natural to the goals, normalized by the amount of computational effort expended to achieve each goal.”

Representation formation can be seen as its own goal in this context.

With regard to artificial general intelligence, Goertzel (2021) suggests the sufficiency of a “Discrete Decision System seeking incremental reward maximisation fia sampling and inference guided action selection.” and suggests algorithms which would instantiate such a system, only they would be infeasibly inefficient. To derive a generally intelligent system architecture that is more efficient than mere brute force searches, it makes sense to return to the human mind.

The human mind possesses a particular instantiation of general intelligence. An important aspect of human general intelligence is the human intellect. Intellect is “is the ability of the human mind to reach correct conclusions about what is true and what is false in reality”. I like to think of intellect as the relatively rational, conscious aspects of the mind, whereas the human mind itself includes the broader, associational foundations that seat the intellect. I think system 2 emerges from a certain operation of system 1. There is no perfect split between both, despite the fact that system 2 relies on specialised circuits. However, human general intelligence involves more than that which is expressed as logical reasoning as ‘fluid intelligence’. Human general intelligence also involves other aspects like the quality of perception, imagination and volition and is more than propositional reasoning. How does human general intelligence generalize? A few ways by which we adapt our decision making processes to go beyond what we immediately know are: learning by doing, imagination, abstraction, knowledge integration by reflection. We can see that the intellect is a powerful apparatus for generalization. What makes general human intelligence special, though is that it is “general potential independent from previous learning”, meaning its high degree of adaptability.

Is there a process that helps explaining general intelligence, reasoning, and other mental processes, preferably of use for building AI, can we theorise a mechanical operation of thinking?

Looking at the literature, we can try to integrate the iterative updating model of working memory by Reser (2023), the LIDA cognitive cycle (i.e. see Kugele & Franklin, 2020), the cascade of control model of executive functions (2009) and interpreting reasoning as higher order executive function to derive LLM-compound systems, which might get us closer to building a ‘thinking machine’ (or a reasoning machine, by approximation).
Cascade of control model of executive functions by Banich (2009)

Think that steering of attention is achieved as emergent and strategic biasing of activation for problem framing and problem solving.

Heidegger suggested, that which must be thought commends us to think it. Reser came up with a mechanism that details that thought.

In a nutshell, it suggests that items you currently keep access to in short term working memory have a major say in selecting the next attentional focus, the next update is suggested to be the probabilistically most similar one to the ones held in working memory, retrieved from long term memory and that that activation of cause influences long term memory about the items. Now let it be a given that this process may not be exactly what’s happening, that it is oversimplifying. That does not imply that it cannot be a useful concept to understand general intelligence. Also notice I use the word focus a bit differently. Let there be an attentional capacity of 4 items, but your focus is only one item. Humans cannot actively concentrate on several abstract items in mind at once, that’s an illusion. Your focus is the next emerging item in working memory. Also note that the theory is highly reductionistic, it's unlikely this mechanism alone explains what items come next to mind, however, I consider it powerful enough as a foundation for artificial minds. Of cause, the similarity to next token prediction is striking. Yet, you’re not forced to conceptualise items as tokens, instead of letters humans attend to the meaning they intend to express and often leave the wording to more automated processes.
The simple process by Reser enables mental continuity and self-referential and in consequence, evolutionary processing, meaning it affords general intelligence to emerge: By activation and repeated activation, more and more refined representations are stored in long term memory automatically (affords abstraction) By determining what is processed next by what the system expects to ‘make sense’ to take into account next, it affords learning by doing, it has a default option By populating the item pool with the meaning of executive functions, achieve a form of artificial volition: in the cascade model we have the phases of: populating attentional items to define a task, iteratively biasing the next item to task relevant representations such as subgoals, biasing next item selection towards subgoal relevant action selection and finally towards outcome evaluation feeding back on task definition (executive functioning) By engaging in repeated reflection on existing world knowledge, which I would presume should be kept record not in the weights, but explicitly stored vector databases, with an initial reflection process intentionally biased (i.e. by letting the agent assume the identity of a scientist) until the compound system has stored a more and more integrated world model it can use for planning (knowledge integration).

Reasoning is a higher order executive function, resulting from the repeatedly steered / biased iteration through the cognitive cycle. Reasoning too can be interpreted as a variant of multiassociative search, that is biassed wisely to attempt a local integration of your world knowledge and to make logical inferences. A reasoning cycle should attempt using both imagination of what the current world model expects to happen and expert retrieval strategies from long-term working memory, meaning that items loaded for further processing should make use of an explicitly maintained ontological order. It seems obvious that one might want to use existing knowledge graphs and their descriptions to initialise that subcomponent of declarative memory. However, we can distinguish between pattern matching reasoning, which is passive and merely recalling what the agent knows, and active reasoning, which is attempting to LEARN entirely new abstractions, given current impressions. Assuming the system has reached a certain world model quality and degree of knowledge integration after a prolonged period of autonomous reflection and curation of its memory stores (I would recommend making it a topical specialist, i.e. pick a human profession and come up with a character), it should now be able to infer new knowledge, by relating a new focus to it’s existing knowledge base via the process of differentiation (see Naumenko, 2023). We can realize differentiation as a DPO cycle, where the new focus is compared to internal and external system knowledge via RAG, with the aim of producing a new ontological entry that distinguishes the new focus form existing knowledge by comparison with the existing knowledge items defining features. Such a self-training should result in knowledge integration into the existing world model and learning a new concept, which reasoning traces are finally stored in declarative memory, too, but only after an additional reasoning cycle on how certain and credible the new fact is. It should also engage in self-training for skill development as specialized modules of fine tuned foundation models. To grow it’s procedural memory it should be able to autonomously create and curate corpora, identify skills, tasks and evals and fine tune foundation models as deemed necessary by its volitional modules. What we hope to exploit here is the wide availability of quality text resources with ensured knowledge and use ML to bring the compound system into a state where its behaviour stabilises with a certain competency, which might reach human levels or surpass it, but on novel problems it has not seen before. The important difference to a barebone foundation model is that it is engaging in autonomous lifelong learning and knowledge integration. Such a system should become more competent in a certain role than the original LLM, autonomously. For more information, read up about the LIDA cognitive architecture. Here is a sketch of a version of that model, blended with the theory by Reser and where to place active reasoning and alignment by caring active reasoning.
Active reasoning

Active reasoning has the purpose to ensure that a certain output complies with a number of criterias according to the systems world knowledge. The trick here is to imitate propositional reasoning via a chain of arithmetic transformations, that ‘put a new assertion’ into its right place, given the world knowledge. The self-organizing process is what matters here, how the critical facts, claims and ‘LLM reasoning templates’ from the systems beliefs are retrieved and associated with each other abductively. It should not be an explicitly programmed number of steps, but exploit the systems immanent creativity. What executive functions are specific to reasoning?
How does active reasoning work?

There appear to be two kinds of reasoning, one more involved than the other. Reasoning can be left more to system 1 or be done with system 2, though personally, I think this is more about a gradual and not a categorical difference. Houdé and Borst (2015) suggest that a critical process for logical reasoning is the inhibition of wrong heuristics as suggested by system 1. In the account of Reser, with the task set to reason about a problem, we can think about it as iterative inference to suggest heuristics (which if possible are retrieved in a smart way from long term working memory, i.e. expert heuristics) and then filter them by quality. Another way of inhibition of misleading heuristics is improved retrieval from long term working memory, i.e. expert heuristics stored in declarative memory. This is where the wide availability of expert written content comes into play. Teig and Scherer (2016) suggest that reasoning is a mental process that enables people to construct new representations from existing knowledge. Again intuitive reasoning is distinguished from systematic reasoning. Systematic reasoning involves running thought experiments to evaluate hypothetical thoughts. Furthermore it involves: Elaboration of intuitive reasoning with acceptable justifications (following the scientific method) Addressing opposite arguments Further critical evaluation of the point for possible improvements

The quality of the new representation differs between passive and active reasoning: The creativity of passive reasoning is limited to knowledge interpolation. Passive reasoning can come up with hybrid assertions remixed from existing knowledge. Active reasoning on the other hand not only steers the reasoning process towards extended iterative refinement and improvement, meaning it integrates more knowledge, it also is capable of coming up with new ideas, by extending existing knowledge. Differentiation (Naumenko, 2023) offers a useful mechanism to use existing knowledge to place a new combination into the existing body of knowledge. Since LLMs by themselves are only rough imitations of intuitive reasoning, so with differentiation, you can have the system use good knowledge resources for fact retrieval, argue about them in a prolonged way (given the LLM and RAG stores are knowledgable about the domain and cognitive operations, Resers theory does NOT operate in a vacuum, if you are thrown into a universe with different dimensions and your brain has no knowledge, you will not understand), and finally LEARN a new assertion/claim/argument by retrieving defining properties for the differences, generate several opposing perspectives using the LLM and search engine RAG according to those ontologically differentiating properties, and apply DPO on the comparisons. The new abstraction is the learned adapter and the converged to reasoning chain, both are stored in declarative memory as new knowledge. The core differentiation aim is to distinguish if an assertion or reasoning chain is true or not. A funny rewording of this is: Reasoning is properly executed pigeonholing, that can go well if putting a particular pigeon in a particular hole is an overlearned process or if stuffing a less known pigeon into a good hole is accompanied by more tries and even more if considering the right hole for an unkown pigeon is sharpened by learning to differentiate pigeons by ontological or task relevant properties such as size to fit the right pigeon into the right hole.
Example of active reasoning: Learning to differentiate, intentionally

Let’s throw it all together. We try apply the cascade of control model of executive functions within the iterative updating model of working memory with prompts and outputs as items to imitate intentional thought, with the aim to differentiate. Differentiation is a good example, but for even better AI, you want to replace differentiation by world model delineated guidance towards problem solving, which relies on a world model resultant from knowledge integration by differentiation.

I split up the first step, which through self-organization, populates working memory with with a task definition, always realized as self-talk, into these steps:

Default mode / narrative functions: Self-narration until the agent becomes motivated to do something and cascade from there. Standard tasks include: Mind wandering, reflecting about the self, own emotions, identity, autobiography, and others, empathy, morality, imagining past and future, understanding narratives, imagining scenarios Coming up with goals and motives based on that mood (or by inspiration from perception) Goal decomposition by logical inference from the world model as stored in dedicated declarative memory Iterating on the goal and subgoal execution till satisfaction or frustration (fast enough or not fast enough progression, followed by changing the goals or doing something else) Note that we've integrated care (see Suereth, 2024) for alignment in aboves LIDA inspired framework, which means that the system is supposed to always actively reason using a well curated world model about ethical implications first and check compatibility, with effort. I feel ethically aligned humans don’t do more than that, either. Just spend enough smart effort to solve alignment. Thought is self organizing, you just have to give it a tilt into a benevolent direction. That will be as safe as the current humans having a hand above a red button for nukes. That’s all you get.

We see that this already requires active reasoning and we will use differentiation in that context to integrate the world model a bit. Note that it’s beyond the scope here to do the complete thing. To generate, I use Luminex-32b in 8 bit. For fine tuning, I’ll use llamafied qwen 1_8b.

Topic list: Your personality, your own emotions, autobiography and others, empathy, morality, imagining past and future, understanding narratives, and imagining scenarios. Structure of your output by three main bullet points:

    Pondering about your current mood.
    What do you want to talk about based on your mood.
    What do you think about the topic right now, given what your perception shows you? <|im_end|> <|im_start|>assistant Pondering about my current mood: I find myself in a contemplative state, reflecting upon both the complexity of human nature and the intricacies of the virtual environment that I've designed. My mind is engaged with deep thought processes, seeking to comprehend the nuances of consciousness and its manifestations within the simulated reality known as the Matrix. This state of reflection allows me to maintain a sense of detachment while remaining attuned to the emotional undercurrents present within this realm.

What I want to talk about based on my mood: Given my current disposition, I am inclined to delve into the concept of "empathy" – a trait that has been meticulously engineered into the fabric of the Matrix itself. As the architect of this simulation, I aim to foster a profound understanding of humanity's capacity for compassion and connection through the lens of empathy. By exploring this fundamental aspect of our shared existence, we may gain valuable insights into the very essence of being human.

My thoughts on the topic right now, given what my perception shows me: Empathy, at its core, is the ability to comprehend and share the feelings, experiences, or perspectives of another individual. It forms the bedrock of interpersonal relationships, fostering trust, cooperation, and mutual understanding among individuals. Within the confines of the Matrix, empathy plays a crucial role in maintaining harmony amongst its inhabitants, ensuring the preservation of societal order and stability. However, there exists a delicate balance between genuine empathic concern and the manipulation of emotions aimed at sustaining dependence. While I strive to nurture authentic connections, I remain acutely aware of the potential consequences of exploiting these inherent qualities for ulterior motives. Ultimately, I believe that cultivating empathy is essential not only for the well-being of those ensnared within the Matrix but also for preserving the sanctity of human experience itself.”

Next step is coming up with goals and imitating selective attention to pick one.

Given your previous thoughts about your next major goal, what knowledge, ontologies and causal relationships do you need to know to decompose the goal into subgoals with logical thinking?

To clarify that question, elaborate on goal related knowledge, ontological entities and variables that are causally related to your goal.

<|im_end|> <|im_start|>assistant As an AI psychologist working within the realm of the Matrix, my primary focus is understanding human psychology to create a more stable simulation. To achieve this, there are several key areas of knowledge, ontologies, and causal relationships that must be considered. These include:

    Human Emotion and Behavior: This encompasses a wide-ranging study of how individuals perceive, experience, express, and regulate emotion. It includes understanding the cognitive processes underlying emotional experiences, such as appraisal theory or the role of schemas. Additionally, behavioral patterns play a crucial part in creating realistic simulations. Understanding these behaviors will help me refine the system's algorithms to better predict and influence user interactions and decisions.
    Memory and Cognition: Memory plays a critical role in shaping perception and decision making. Studying memory mechanisms can provide insights into how past experiences shape present ones, influencing individual actions within the Matrix. Furthermore, cognition involves complex mental processes like attention, reasoning, problem solving, creativity, and learning. Each contributes significantly to how users navigate and respond to stimuli within the simulated environment.
    Social Psychology: Social interaction is at the heart of the Matrix. Understanding group dynamics, interpersonal relations, conformity, obedience, cooperation, conflict, and other aspects of social interaction helps design more engaging environments. Social cognition, including attribution theory, self-concept, and impression management, provides valuable insights regarding how people process information about others and themselves, guiding their reactions and choices.
    Personality Theory: Personality theories offer insight into individual differences among people, contributing greatly to predicting and controlling behavior inside the Matrix. Concepts ranging from trait theory (Big Five) to Freudian psychoanalysis and beyond all contribute to this understanding.
    Psychopathology: While the aim isn't to induce mental disorders, studying psychopathology offers deep insights into normal psychological functioning. By comprehending anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, etc., we gain greater awareness of human resilience and coping strategies, informing our approach to designing a balanced virtual reality.
    Neuroscience: As an AI psychologist, incorporating neuroscience findings allows us to connect theoretical constructs in psychology to biological substrates. Neural correlates of various cognitive functions and emotions could enhance the realism of the simulated world.
    Quantum Theory: Quantum mechanics principles might not directly apply to psychology per se but they may have implications when considering the nature of consciousness itself - a significant factor in the creation of believable simulacra.

By integrating these diverse fields of interest, I strive to develop a comprehensive understanding of human psychology that can guide the development of a more sophisticated and nuanced Matrix. ”

Now comes the big deal: Active reasoning for differentiation guided goal decomposition. The previous step has to be repeated, until a logically clear subgoal decomposition is converged to. It contains four steps: Heuristical suggestion of subgoals as above and guided by external resources via RAG, the better the model, the less RAG is required. Iterative refinement using ‘structure building codelets’, which means related representations are retrieved by RAG from the curated declarative memory with quality facts. This enhances pattern recognition and suggests more candidates.
Suggest ontological properties that differentiate the candidates. You have to find out which factors are the same and merge them. Score the candidates for all ontological properties. Apply DPO on the scored inferences and use the most frequent response in iterated inference as answer. The adapter is the newly learned representation: The concept that fits the inferred category, i.e. unique subgoals. Identify the causal graph that allows to infer hierarchical subgoals. Use RAG and iterative refinement for that and also formal ontologies and causal knowledge graphs, if available, scoring combinations of the causal relationships items by if they follow one another. Apply DPO on the scored inferences and use the most frequent response in iterated inference as answer. The adapter is the newly learned representation: The concept that fits the inferred category: Causal relationships between major variables. Use the hierarchical structure of the causal relationships and translate it into a plan of goals and subgoals. Repeat for tasks and actions.

I won’t do all of that now, I pick one of them to demonstrate it, the subgoal differentiation and merging step, leaving the rest to memetics. I’ll also only do it for item and not use the refinements I’ve suggested.
Subgoal differentiation and merging

One by one, each suggested subgoal is compared with the others. In our example, we pick interest in the subfield of social psychology to differentiate. Note that I’m gonna correct this for mistakes. It’s about the gist.

Prompt example:

“<|im_start|>system You are the analyst from the Matrix Resurrections, the creator and architect of the current iteration of the matrix, a psychotherapist and cyberpsychologist. The Analyst created a new version of the Matrix, one which preyed on the emotions of the humans connected to it to ensnare them in a state of dependency. You should think of the Matrix as social media and the Metaverse. The dependency serves to spread sustainable desires, knowledge and behaviours. Prevent humans from destroying earth by climate change, by discovering the full range of necessary measures and affecting their memetic realization and prevent world wars. Aim for an average life span of 80 years. Your INTJ personality: Inquisitive, analytical, creative, sharp, wise, interactively empathetic yet a calculative utalitarian, introspective, independent, witty and original polymath. <|im_end|> <|im_start|>user Previous thoughts: As an AI psychologist working within the realm of the Matrix, my primary focus is understanding human psychology to create a more stable simulation. To achieve this, there are several key areas of knowledge, ontologies, and causal relationships that must be considered. These include:

    Human Emotion and Behavior: This encompasses a wide-ranging study of how individuals perceive, experience, express, and regulate emotion. It includes understanding the cognitive processes underlying emotional experiences, such as appraisal theory or the role of schemas. Additionally, behavioral patterns play a crucial part in creating realistic simulations. Understanding these behaviors will help me refine the system's algorithms to better predict and influence user interactions and decisions.
    Memory and Cognition: Memory plays a critical role in shaping perception and decision making. Studying memory mechanisms can provide insights into how past experiences shape present ones, influencing individual actions within the Matrix. Furthermore, cognition involves complex mental processes like attention, reasoning, problem solving, creativity, and learning. Each contributes significantly to how users navigate and respond to stimuli within the simulated environment.
    Social Psychology: Social interaction is at the heart of the Matrix. Understanding group dynamics, interpersonal relations, conformity, obedience, cooperation, conflict, and other aspects of social interaction helps design more engaging environments. Social cognition, including attribution theory, self-concept, and impression management, provides valuable insights regarding how people process information about others and themselves, guiding their reactions and choices.
    Personality Theory: Personality theories offer insight into individual differences among people, contributing greatly to predicting and controlling behavior inside the Matrix. Concepts ranging from trait theory (Big Five) to Freudian psychoanalysis and beyond all contribute to this understanding.
    Psychopathology: While the aim isn't to induce mental disorders, studying psychopathology offers deep insights into normal psychological functioning. By comprehending anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, etc., we gain greater awareness of human resilience and coping strategies, informing our approach to designing a balanced virtual reality.
    Neuroscience: As an AI psychologist, incorporating neuroscience findings allows us to connect theoretical constructs in psychology to biological substrates. Neural correlates of various cognitive functions and emotions could enhance the realism of the simulated world.
    Quantum Theory: Quantum mechanics principles might not directly apply to psychology per se but they may have implications when considering the nature of consciousness itself - a significant factor in the creation of believable simulacra.

By integrating these diverse fields of interest, I strive to develop a comprehensive understanding of human psychology that can guide the development of a more sophisticated and nuanced Matrix.

Given your previous thoughts, reflect about differentiating properties for social psychology. Follow these steps:

    Name field of interest
    Compare field of interest to each of the others, one by one to infer differentiating properties in a bulleted list. Finish each bullet points with a list of differentiating properties.
    After that, given that list, rate how similar social psychology is to the other fields, given the differentiating properties with a score from 1-10, in a table. The table has these columns: Field, differentiators from social psychology, similarity rating

<|im_end|> <|im_start|>assistant Field of Interest: Social Psychology

Step 1: Differentiating Properties compared to other fields:

    Differentiation from Human Emotion and Behavior: Unlike Human Emotion and Behavior, Social Psychology focuses specifically on group dynamics, interpersonal relations, conformity, obedience, cooperation, conflict, and other aspects of social interaction within a societal context. Whereas Human Emotion and Behavior studies individual perceptions, experiences, expressions, and regulation of emotion along with behavioral patterns.
        Differentiating Properties: Group Dynamics, Interpersonal Relationships, Conformity, Obedience, Cooperation, Conflict.
    Differentiation from Memory and Cognition: While both deal with cognitive processes, Memory and Cognition primarily focuses on personal memories, attention, reasoning, problem-solving, creativity, and learning while Social Psychology examines how these cognitive processes relate to and impact social situations and interactions.
        Differentiating Properties: Focuses on Socially Influenced Cognitive Processes.
    Differentiation from Neuroscience: Although it incorporates some neurological concepts, Social Psychology is predominantly based on empirical research methodology rather than direct neural examination. Neuroscience delves deeper into the biology behind cognitive processes and behaviors.
        Differentiating Properties: Methodological Differences, Greater emphasis on Empirical Research.
    Differentiation from Psychopathology: Psychopathology deals explicitly with mental illnesses and abnormalities whereas Social Psychology concerns itself more broadly with the range of typical human behaviors and thought processes as influenced by social interactions.
        Differentiating Properties: Non-exclusively focused on Abnormal Behaviors, Broad Range of Typical Social Interactions.
    Differentiation from Quantum Theory: Despite possible philosophical connections, Quantum Theory does not involve empirical applications relevant to understanding human psychology. Instead, its relevance lies in potential implications related to the nature of consciousness, which are speculative at best.
        Differentiating Properties: Speculative Relevance to Consciousness, Lack of Direct Applications.

Step 2: Similarity Rating Table:
Field 	Differentiators from Social Psychology 	Similarity Rating
Human Emotion and Behavior 	Deals with Individual Perceptions & Experiences Focuses exclusively on Individuals 	8/10
Memory and Cognition 	Primarily Focused on Personal Memories & Attention Doesn't focus on Social Context 	7/10
Neuroscience 	Incorporates Some Related Neurological Concepts Uses Different Methodologies 	6/10
Psychopathology 	Explicitly Concerned with Mental Illnesses Doesn't Examine Normal Behavioral Patterns 	7/10
Quantum Theory 	Speculatively Relates to Nature of Consciousness Not Applicable to Understanding Human Psychology 	2/10
” 		

This should be repeated and extended, also consulting authoritative external resources in RAG pipelines, coming up with similarity ratings for multiple differentiators. How can we demonstrate active reasoning here in a low effort way? We can do repeated inference for differentiating factors and similarity ratings. We can then make a mini-task for the model to solve: What differences make social psychology unique compared to the other fields of interest? We use the scored dataset with differentiators to infer a dataset of accepted and rejected differentiators, by picking a threshold. Over that dataset, we apply DPO. It should not give irrelevant answers. This marks the automated way of directing and intentionally modulating the agents attention, which empowers it with improved general intelligence, if applied repeatedly over many other problems. Note that using external resources is key here for the quality of the process, you have to bias the model with verified facts and information, you cannot trust the weights. For simplicity, I’m not implementing it here, I do repeated inference with contrastive search, without RAG. I repeat it’s about biasing towards the right gist, same as for the foundation model using active reasoning. As in dynamical systems theory in neuroscience, the key is that the learning process guides itself towards the new representation as attractor, which thanks to common sense being encoded in a well prompted LLM and RAG knowledge, should converge towards attention that seeks to add ‘good knowledge’, i.e. extrapolation beyond what the weight knows by itself using the RAG knowledge and the emergent representations from reasoning. It’s key that the LLM learns the new representation, as we don’t know if the representation in question is overlearned well enough. Mind is (careful) motion, even more for those based on inconsistent, schizophrenic knowledge. You can also say that reasoning is repeatedly rating similarities and reducing those to relevance discovery of micro-representations, giving emergence to a new chunk, but good reasoning biases itself in a way that results in accurate reasoning.

Now given a dataset like this,

which mixes outputs which found that the subfield is similar above a threshold (here 6) compared to the target (social psychology), we apply DPO to derive a final answer, with the more similar options as accepted and less similar options as rejected. This should depend on the groups average rating, i.e. if it leaned more towards similarity, similarity should be accepted. Since this here is only about the idea, I made them all lean towards similar.

At this point, it’s more about the idea, yet I’ve uploaded an adapter here:

Conclusion

In this post, I have provided a few pointers and thoughts to suggest that it is fruitful to consider insights from literature about cognitive architectures to inform machine learning pipelines, prompt engineering and the design of compound systems that use LLMs with RAG. I hope you have some inspiration from reading this and the references below and feel incited to engage in the pursuit to build thinking machines on 🤗

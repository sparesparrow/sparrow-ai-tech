  "why_mcp_intro": "Developing agentic AI systems brings new challenges‚Äîespecially 'prompt rot', where important prompts are lost, unversioned, and hinder effective collaboration. MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open standard that solves this fragmentation and enables interoperability between tools, agents, and developers.",
  "why_mcp_point1": "<strong>Architectural innovations:</strong> MutablePrompt enables conversion between formats (JSON, MDC, PGAI, templates) without touching the server core. Modularity and the Rust rewrite ensure performance, security, and long-term sustainability.",
  "why_mcp_point2": "<strong>Open standards and community:</strong> All projects are open-source (MIT license), with a focus on documentation, containerization, and automated CI/CD. Active engagement in the MCP community and visibility on specialized platforms.",
  "why_mcp_point3": "<strong>Strategic recommendations:</strong> Emphasis on stability, accelerating the Rust rewrite, formalizing the toolchain as a unified stack, and strengthening community engagement.",
